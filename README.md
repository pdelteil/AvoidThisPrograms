# Results - Stats 

Programs will be measured in an (somewhat) objective manner based on:

1. Severity of the initial report
2. Waiting time (total time between  inital report and final resolution)
3. Level of bad threament to the reporter.  
4. Bonus points if the researcher was punished by taking reputation points or other measure. 

Points
We will be using Intigriti's pointing system for severity scoring. 

Critical
High
Medium
Low 

Final score will be the result of: severity_points +
